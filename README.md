# Advent of Code 2022

## What is Advent of Code?

> Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar for programmers, where each day of December you are provided with a new problem to solve with a language of your choice. Each year has a fantastic plot and story line you can follow along with as you solve each days challenge.
>
> Every day for 25 days this month you have small programming challenges that you need to solve to complete the "tree" and help the elves with their mission. Each day, the questions get a little bit harder to really push you to learn and improve your programming skills.
